## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table  
Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,  
She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage  
To meet him in the doorway with the news  
And put him on his guard. ‘Silas is back.’  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->

In ascetic silence, in stony skirts,  
God’s handmaid falls on her face –  
Flash of an empty night, a forlorn desert waste,  
Shards of sunset upon the rocks.  

This land. Trodden, just like this, by a wandering sadness,  
Trailing in her thunders, calling her: ‘Where art thou?’  
Speak to her, tell her of things that are other,   
Tell her of fields that are learning to smile.  

For it was your arms that held up her slumped head,  
For it was you who injected her bloodstream with youth,  
As she drank in the dew with noisy lips  
And bore a tractor in her heart.
